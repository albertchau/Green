What is this directory?
===

This directory usually is ignored because it is created and all required files will be copied there when you run command

	$ bower install

But since we have automatic deploy to Windows Azure server for demo and Windows Azure does not run this command,
all required files have to be already there. This is why I included this bower instalation directory with only required files.
